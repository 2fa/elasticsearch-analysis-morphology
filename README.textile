h1. Morphological Analysis Plugin for ElasticSearch

The Morphological Analysis plugin integrates <a href="http://code.google.com/p/russianmorphology/">Russian and English morphology for java and lucene 3.0 framework</a> into elasticsearch. This plugin adds two new analyzers: "russian_morphology" and "english_morphology" and two token filters with the same names.
